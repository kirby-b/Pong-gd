# Pong GD

This was a small project to learn how to use c# in Godot. It has taught me a lot, especially the correct used of c# with godot. Dont get me wrong; C# works fine as a controller for basic stuff like this. But 
GDScript works better in a lot of ways. This isnt Godot or C#'s fault and it ultimatly comes down to one thing: GDScript is made for godot and C# is just supported. This means that gd will always work better 
for actually working with the engine, which is why a lot of people mainly use C# for math and heavy calculations that run slower with GDScript. 

In conclusion, both are acceptable languages, both are valueable to learn, and you shouldnt choose just one of these languages to use(this applys to a lot of things actually)
