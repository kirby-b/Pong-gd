# Pong GD

This was a small project to learn how to use c# in Godot. It has taught me a lot, especially the correct used of c# with godot. Using C# for almost everything in this project was a nightmare. 
C# for godot only really works for math behind the scenes, and even then it can be annoying. The hardest part of this project was making the enemy computer paddle follow the balls Y of all things 
and I still am not happy with how it works, so I chose to make both paddles players(one with WASD, the other with arrow keys)
